A 60-point challenge, and I—the warrior, second to none—did 14 push-ups to get it, hahaha! It was only supposed to be 10 at first, but then an INE2 girl decided I should do 13 instead. That’s when the brilliant INE2 data mind asked me, "Are you from Reda Slaoui?"

I said no, honestly, but he looked me up and down and said, “Sorry man, there’s nothing I can do for you!” Then he dropped some wisdom—13 is a prime number, so we should make it 14, hahaha.

In the end, I think I did 15 or 16 push-ups, lost count! You know how it goes with INE2 hhh, they prank us a lot bizus this time of the year!
