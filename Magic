This was the moment I realized I can rap as fast as Eminem, hahaha! The challenge? Count to 100 in 25 seconds!

That means you need to go 4x your normal speed—no pressure! I’m not sure how many seconds it took me, but one thing’s for sure: I just discovered a new talent, hahaha!

Big thanks to whoever made this challenge. It was a good one, and I definitely enjoyed it!

bingo ! we got 60 pts hehehe
