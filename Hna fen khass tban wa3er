ThisThis one got me scared at first. It was a 300-point challenge, and the reason I wasn't confident was because of the description: "JAVA." Believe me, who wouldn't be scared of Java as a beginner? Even senior devs avoid it when handling the back-end or server side!

I'm not sure who created this challenge, but they sure played a prank on me. Later, I discovered it was just JavaScript! And to my surprise, the flag wasnâ€™t even hidden in some complex function manipulation. It was in plain text. All you had to do was read through the `main.js` file, and bingo:

```javascript
/**
 * This function will handle when another user answers to our offer.
 */
function onAnswer(answer) {
    console.log("when another user answers to offer => answer = " + answer);
    document.getElementById('dynamic_progress_text').setAttribute('data-loading-text', "Waiting for an answer from the user..Please wait ..");
    peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(answer));
    send({
        type: "ready" // here is the last function handling connection between peers and does not affect any member [==> C*I*T{M13liKcH_R1K_NAdI(a)} ] {without *}
    });


The flag is CIT{M13liKcH_R1K_NAdI(a)}
