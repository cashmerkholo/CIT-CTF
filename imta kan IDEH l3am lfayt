This one was a pretty interesting challenge. a 260 pts challenge. We downloaded a JPEG image named ideh2.jpg.
( at first I thought maybe i should be digging to dates, when the image was accessed/modified etc ..)

Step 1: Check the metadata

First thing I did was run exiftool on the image to see if there was anything hidden in the metadata:
```bash
jkome0x@44-03-2C-69-F0-32:~/Downloads$ exiftool ideh2.jpg
ExifTool Version Number         : 12.76
File Name                       : ideh2.jpg
Directory                       : .
File Size                       : 472 kB
File Modification Date/Time     : 2024:09:28 23:20:39+01:00

File Inode Change Date/Time     : 2024:09:29 11:14:44+01:00
File Permissions                : -rw-rw-r--
File Type                       : JPEG
File Type Extension             : jpg

JFIF Version                    : 1.01

X Resolution                    : 72
Y Resolution                    : 72
Comment                         : tbarklah 3lik albatal(a)
Image Width                     : 1440
Image Height                    : 1800
Encoding Process                : Baseline DCT, Huffman coding
Bits Per Sample                 : 8

Y Cb Cr Sub Sampling            : YCbCr4:2:0 (2 2)
Image Size                      : 1440x1800
Megapixels                      : 2.6

As you can see the comment in the metadata:
tbarklah 3lik albatal(a)
a nice little boost, but nothing that gave me the flag yet. Thanks whoever created this hahaha

Step 2: Steganography

Given the image, I figured there might be more hidden data. So, I used steghide to see if anything was embedded in the image file:

```bash
jkome0x@44-03-2C-69-F0-32:~/Downloads$ steghide extract -sf ideh2.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".

Once I entered the passphrase (which I left empty ), I was able to extract the hidden data into a file called flag.txt.

Step 3: The hint

Now all we had to do is read the flag.txt file, using the cat command we got :  CIT{DaT3_Is_13_14_JaNvI3E4}
