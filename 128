this is a 100pts challenge :
we downloaded the text file and it has "UTBsVWUwdzNRVTFCUVRsZlNHRkJaR0Y5DQo"
128 is a hint, the first thing I thought of is that is encrypted twice using base64 , to my luck, that was the case !
UTBsVWUwdzNRVTFCUVRsZlNHRkJaR0Y5DQo ===> Q0lUe0w3QU1BQTlfSGFBZGF9
Q0lUe0w3QU1BQTlfSGFBZGF9            ===> CIT{L7AMAA9_HaAda}
and that is our flag there !
