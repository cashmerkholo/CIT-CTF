This one is a 250-point challenge. Although it seems to fall under the steganography category, there wasn’t really any hidden data.

To solve this:

1. Download and unzip the `chalenge_6.rar` file.
2. There were a bunch of files. The path where the real game starts is:  
   `/home/jkome0x/Downloads/chalenge 6/cit/the_moon/home`
3. Use the `ls` command to list the directory contents. You'll find a file named `checksum.txt` and another directory called `files` with a bunch of other files—most of them are ASCII text.

How did I know this?

You can use the following command to check the file types:

```bash
file *
The most suspicious one was the PNG image file 134hi!67.png. It turned out to be a QR code, so we scanned it and got this link:
https://qrco.de/bfRAuT

The link led to a PDF file, and its contents were:
______________________
iwa 3la slaaammaa:
CIT{a7s@en_Ha1cC@ker}
______________________
And that was obviously our flag: CIT{a7s@en_Ha1cC@ker}.

This is why I said I’m not sure it was steganography, I really don’t understand the objective of this one!
